        Pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil,
        oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial
        setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.It’s late at night and you want to nibble on something good but don’t feel like cooking. That’s the perfect occasion to
        order the family a pizza. But there’s so much more to pizza than you’d think. There are many varieties found around the
        globe. Here are some of the most popular pizzas out there. Get inspired and maybe next time you’ll discover a new one to
        try.
        
        A crunchy and yet soft crust. A mouthful of sweet and slightly tangy, fresh tomato sauce. Gooey, rich, unctuous cheese.
        Toppings of choice. It’s pizza time! While we take pizza for granted, there are many ways to enjoy this great dish.
